# Let's Learn Lisp with Lee!

This is a short exploration into building a fully featured Lisp-1. This source
builds up a lexer and parser, a lisp evaluator, a full set of lisp features and
a common function library.

*Note:* This is a work in progress. The eventual goal is a series of articles
walking through this source, piece by piece.
